## Trends of Fraud in the US
By Davin Kaing, Nikhita Kandikonda, and Praneeth Tamvada

## Abstract
On average, fraud costs approximately 5% of an organization annual revenue [1]. This burden not only impacts the economy overall, it threatens the security of information. To better understand this issue, we examined the trend of various types of frauds, their economic costs, and the tar- getted age group. We built predictive models to forcast these factors into the future and present recommendations on how to best approach this problem. 

## Background Research & Questions
As we enter the exciting era of big data, there is an enormous amount of information and tools that can help drive effective decisions. However, one of the biggest concerns is fraud. According to a survey conducted by Ernst & Young [2], one-third of global organizations arenâ€™t prepared for cyber breach. This poses a concern for the security of confidential data and it affects many organizations ranging from pharmaceutical industry to financial services. In this paper, we focus on the impact of fraud in the United States. We use linear regression to examine the trends of the last 6 years (2010-2015) of fraud data retrieved from Federal Trade Commission website [3]. We then used these trends to project into the next 6 years (2016-2021). We also examine the economic costs of fraud and the targeted age groups.

## Tools Used
This project is completed in both R and Python. We apply linear regression to build our models. To visualize our results, we use ggplot for both R and Python. For our analysis in python, we use the following packages: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, ggplot, collections, matplotlib, and warnings.
